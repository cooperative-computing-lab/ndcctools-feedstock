# Note we use the name "ndcctools" as there is already another project in

    The Cooperative Computing Tools (cctools) are a collection of programs that
    enable large scale distributed computing on systems such as clusters,
    clouds, and grids. These tools are commonly used in fields of science and
    engineering that rely on large amounts of computing.
